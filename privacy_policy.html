    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 2026-01-03</strong></p>

    <p>
        Beyond The Limit Studio built the FastTwit app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
        Beyond The Limit Studio at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
        disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
        to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
        Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
        Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is
        accessible at FastTwit unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain
        personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device
        and is not collected by me in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

    <h2>Twitter/X Account Login and Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose of Login:</strong> Our app offers an optional feature to log in to your Twitter / X account.
        This feature is <strong>strictly optional</strong> and is only required if you wish to download content that is
        marked as "sensitive," "age-restricted," or "private" by Twitter (content that you are otherwise authorized to
        view). Public videos can be downloaded without logging in.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No Credential Collection:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or transmit your Twitter
        username or password. The login process happens directly on Twitter's secure website via an embedded browser
        view.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cookie Usage:</strong> When you log in successfully, the app saves your authentication cookies
        (specifically `auth_token` and `ct0`) locally on your device.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> These cookies are stored securely on your device's internal storage and
            are <strong>never</strong> sent to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> The app uses these cookies solely to authenticate requests sent directly to
            Twitter's API to fetch the video data you requested. This allows the app to "act as you" to download the
            content you have access to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Log Data</h2>
    <p>
        I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
        I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data.
        This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
        device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
        These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
        internal memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code
        and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
        to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
        choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
        I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
        Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However,
        they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
        commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
        the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The app requires the following permissions to function correctly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage (Photos/Media/Files):</strong> This permission is required to save downloaded videos and
            images to your device's external storage. We do not access, modify, or delete any other personal files on
            your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> This permission is required to download content from the internet and to serve
            ads (via AdMob) and collect analytical data (via Firebase).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion Policy</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No Personal Data Collected by Developer:</strong> FastTwit does not require you to create an account
        with us, and we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data (such as names, emails, or phone
        numbers) to our own servers. All data processing related to video downloads happens locally on your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Data:</strong> Data collected by third-party services (AdMob, Firebase) is governed by their
        respective privacy policies and data retention periods.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>User Data Deletion:</strong> Since we do not create user accounts or store personal data on our servers,
        there is no account or data to request deletion for. You can clear the app's local data (cache/storage) and
        uninstall the app at any time to remove all locally stored information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Safety</h2>
    <p>
        In compliance with Google Play's Data Safety section:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Shared with Third Parties:</strong> We do not share any personal user data with third party
            companies or organizations, except as required for the operation of third-party libraries (AdMob, Firebase)
            mentioned above.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> All network communication (downloads) is performed over secure HTTPS
            connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be
        directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
        advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no
        responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
        under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
        our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
        personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
        on this page.
    </p>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 2026-01-03</p>
